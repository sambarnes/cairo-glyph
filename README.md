# glyph

A proof-of-concept package manager for Cairo contracts/libraries. Distribution through pypi. Installation through existing package managers -- pip, pipenv, poetry.

Intended to be a lightweight layer on top of existing python package management. Sole responsibility is collecting contracts/libraries registered to the `contracts` [namespace package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/#using-namespace-packages), and copying their contents to a new `contracts/lib` folder.

## Usage

## Library Setup

In order to allow your contracts to be installed, a few conventions must be followed.

```
contracts                # The "namespace package" that the contracts are installed to
â””â”€â”€ placeholder          # The library you are distributing
    â”œâ”€â”€ contract.cairo
    â””â”€â”€ __init__.py      # Required to be installable.
setup.py                 # The installer
```

The actual `setup.py` will look something like this:

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name="placeholder",

    version="1",
    description="",
    long_description="",

    author="Jane Doe",
    author_email="author@example.com",

    license="MIT License",

    packages=["contracts.placeholder"],
    # Include all extra package data. Possible to include *.cairo only
    package_data={"": ["*"]},
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

Once distributed on pypi, one could:
```
(venv) $ pip install cairo-glyph cairo-placeholder
...
(venv) $ glyph use placeholder
ðŸ”Ž Discovering installed contracts...

 â€¢ Using contracts.placeholder

âœ… Done.
```

Adding the following to your project:
```
contracts/
â””â”€â”€ libs
    â””â”€â”€ placeholder
        â””â”€â”€ contract.cairo
```
